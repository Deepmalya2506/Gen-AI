This paper investigates the speculative yet compelling hypothesis that planetary alignments may subtly influence Earth’s geomagnetic field, with downstream effects on human biological systems. Drawing from astrophysical models, biophysical literature, and symbolic systems theory, we propose a framework for understanding how gravitational and electromagnetic interactions between celestial bodies could modulate Earth’s magnetic environment—and how such modulations might affect neurological, cardiovascular, and cellular processes in humans. While empirical evidence remains limited, we argue that this interdisciplinary inquiry opens new pathways for understanding human sensitivity to cosmic rhythms.
